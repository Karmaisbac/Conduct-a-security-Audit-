# Conduct a security Audit 
This project's objective is to use a practice scenario to perform a security audit. 

I reviewed the scenario, scope, goals, and risk assessment. 
I went on to the checklist in which I ticked yes or no based on what I deemed to be correct using the information given to me in the risk assessment.
I reviewed my checklist using the examplar. 
I found out that some of the checkboxes were wrong due to my thinking. 

In the control assessment checklist, I ticked yes for the password policies because they had one even though it wasn't secure enough. I've come to the realization that isn't a policy. If it isn't secure why would it be seen as a policy? 

I also ticked yes for the manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention for legacy systems which was also wrong. There was monitoring and maintenance but it didn't have a regular schedule, policies related to intervention were unclear and that poses a risk.

In the System and Organizational Controls section, I ticked yes for the data availability for authorized users which was false because the data is open to all the employees and there isn't any limitation on who is able to access it. 

This was my first time conducting a security audit and I felt like it was going to be easy. Instead, this enabled me to change my thinking and not be complacent.
